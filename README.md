Building Images Dataset 

This notebook uses a dataset of building images, designed for training image-to-image translation models such as Pix2Pix GAN.

Dataset Details:

All input images are stored in the read-only ../input/ directory.

Each image may represent different building types, architectures, or layouts.

The images can be used for tasks like map-to-image translation, super-resolution, or image generation.
